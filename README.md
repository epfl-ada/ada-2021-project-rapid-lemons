# Project proposal
Study on gender bias and occupation of the speakers, thematic analysis based on title of articles

## Abstract

Our project aims to perform a thematic analysis of the quotes featured in newspapers with a focus on the speaker’s gender and occupation. First, the idea is to study the male to female ratio within speakers quoted for a certain news topic. We are curious to see in which fields there are more men or women who expressed themselves, which gender is more quoted and, in some sort, has a larger voice in the media. Then, we can investigate how related the speaker is to the topic they were quoted in.

## Research Questions

We would like to know if there is a gender bias in the number of quotes and the length of quotes, how this possible bias evolves along the years, and how related it is to the occupation of the speaker. We also want to understand how related each speaker’s occupation is compared to the theme of the original article, and if certain themes/topics also present a gender bias.
